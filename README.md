vcdExtra: Extensions and additions to vcd: Visualizing Categorical Data
=======================================================================

This package provides additional data sets, documentation, and
a few functions designed to extend the [vcd](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcd) package for *Visualizing Categorical Data*
and the [gnm](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package for *Generalized Nonlinear Models*. 
In particular, vcdExtra extends mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from vcd to handle `glm()` and `gnm()` models and
adds a 3D version in `mosaic3d`.
